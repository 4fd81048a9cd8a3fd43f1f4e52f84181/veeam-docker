# Veeam Projects using Docker
This repository contains several projects that leverage the Docker Engine to run Veeam services in containers.

The [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com) is a container runtime that provides management and packaging tools for runing services. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 

## üìó Documentation

Documentation for each project can be found in the individual folders within the repo.  Projects in this repository must contain at least a Dockerfile that allows buidling of a Docker image locally using "docker build" but some projects may also offer pre-built images available from repositories hosted via the official [Docker Hub VeeamHub organzation](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/veeamhub).
